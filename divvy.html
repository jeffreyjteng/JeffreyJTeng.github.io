									What are some effective strategies to advertise the membership program and encourage casual riders to become members?<br>
								<br>
									<h3 class="major">QUESTIONS TO ANSWER</h3>
									<p>
										
										1. What are the current member rider and casual rider count in the year of 2021 and 2022?<br>	
										2. What are the member growth throughout the year of 2021 and 2022?<br>	
										3. What are the differences in service usage between members and casual riders for different time period?<br>	
										4. Can we identify any patterns or trends in ride time based on start and end station, or bike type?<br>
										5. How can the limited data available be used to inform marketing strategies?<br>
									  </p>

									<h3 class="major">DATA ANALYSIS</h3>
									  	<b>1. Rides recorded for 2021 and 2022</b>
										 
										<li>Total rides recorded in 2021: a total of 4.5 million rides were recorded, with 2.5 million contributed by members and 2 million by casual riders, where members accounted for 55% of the total riders. </li>
										<li>Total rides recorded in 2022: a total of 4.3 million rides, with 2.6 million contributed by members and 1.7 million by casual riders, where members accounted for 60% of the total riders </li>
										  <br>
										 <b>2. Member Growth and Ride Count Decrease</b>
										 <li>Despite the increase in member usage from 2021 to 2022, the total ride count decreased by 5.16%.</li>
										 <li>Currently, the number of members utilizing the service exceeds that of casual riders. However, the usage percentage of casual riders stands at 40%, indicating significant potential for conversion to the membership program.</li>
										 <li>This suggests a considerable opportunity to attract a substantial portion of casual riders and encourage them to become members.</li> 
										  
										<br>
										<b>3. Performance by Quarter</b>
										<li>In 2022, the peak bike usage occurred during the third quarter, with a total of 1.7 million usage counts. Similarly, in 2021, the peak bike usage was also during the third quarter, with 1.9 million usage counts. </li>

										<li>From 2021 to 2022, both member and casual riders experienced peak usage during the months of May to September, which can be attributed to the onset of summer vacation. </li>
										<li>During this period, students tend to utilize the service more frequently, and the city attracts a higher number of tourists. On the other hand, the months of January to March marked the lowest point of usage for both years. </li>
										<li>This decline in usage can be attributed to the resumption of school after the winter break, as well as the conclusion of holiday seasons like Christmas and Thanksgiving. As people return to their regular school and work routines, the demand for the bike service decreases.</li>
										
										<br>
										<b>4. Different Bike Type in 2022 </b>
										<li>For electric bikes, the afternoon was the time period when users utilized the service the most, accounting for 44% of the total usage. Thursdays were the days when electric bikes were used the most, representing 15% of the total usage.</li>
										<li>For docked bikes, the afternoon was the peak time period for usage, accounting for 51.92% of the total usage. Saturdays were the most popular days for docked bike usage, constituting 23% of the total usage.</li>
										<li>For classic bikes, the afternoon was also the time period with the highest usage, making up 43% of the total usage. Saturdays were the most preferred days for classic bike usage.</li>
										<li>From this data, we can infer that the afternoon is the peak time period for bike usage, and Saturdays are the most popular days for users to utilize the service, regardless of bike type.</li>
										<li>Among casual riders, the classic bike type exhibits the highest ride frequency, followed by the electric bike type, with the docked bike type being the least preferred. On the other hand, among member riders, the classic bike type has the highest ride frequency, the electric bike type ranks second, and the docked bike type is the least commonly used.</li>
										<li>Given that the classic bike type is the most utilized among casual riders, promoting this specific bike type can be an effective strategy to increase the overall usage of the service.</li>
										<li>By highlighting the advantages and features of classic bikes, such as their convenience, availability, and reliability, potential users can be encouraged to opt for this bike type when utilizing the service.</li> 
										<li>Offering targeted promotions or incentives specifically for classic bikes can further incentivize casual riders to choose this option, ultimately increasing the likelihood of attracting more people to use the service.</li>
										<br>

										<b>5. Total Ride Duration Time </b>
										<li>In th year of 2022, the total ride time for both member and causal rider combine is around 49,270 days of ride time</li>
										<li>in 2021, the total ride time is equavilanet to 60,139 day.</li>
										<li> The total ride time decrease by 18% from 2021 to 2022. </li>
										<li>The average ride time is around 16 minutes 
											in 2022 and 19 minutes in 2021 which decrease by 13%.</li>
										<br>
										
										<b>6. Top 5 Stations in 2022</b>
										<li>Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, DuSable Lake Shore Dr & North Blvd, Michigan Ave & Oak St, Wells St & Concord Ln </li>
										<li>Strategically placing onsite advertisements at these key locations with high casual rider traffic can ensure maximum exposure to the casual rider demographic.</li>
										<li>Additionally, identifying the popular routes that casual riders take opens up an opportunity to collaborate with famous or popular restaurants and stores located along these routes.</li>
										<li> Establishing partnerships with store owners to offer discounts or special promotions for casual riders can incentivize them to make stops along their route, enhancing their overall experience and promoting customer loyalty.</li>
										<li>This approach leverages the visibility and convenience of these establishments to attract and retain more riders</li>

										<br> <br>
