									<h3 class="major">PROJECT DASHBOARD</h3>
									<h3 class="major">GOAL</h3>
									Improve understanding of San Francisco and increase public safety by identifying high-risk areas and times through data analysis, and provide recommendations for reducing incident rates.<br>

									<br>
					
									<h3 class="major">QUESTIONS TO ANSWER</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>Crime Pattern Analysis:</strong><br>
										1. Identify the most frequent types of incidents based on the incident description.<br>
										2. Analyze incident occurrences by police district or neighborhood to identify areas with higher crime rates.<br>
										3. Determine the most common times (hourly, daily, or weekly) for incidents to occur.
									  </p>

									  <p>
										<strong>Hotspot Analysis:</strong><br>
										1. Visualize incidents on a map using latitudes and longitudes to identify geographic hotspots of crime.<br>
										2. Calculate the density of incidents in different intersections, police districts, or neighborhoods to pinpoint areas with a high concentration of incidents.<br>
									  </p>
									  
									  <p>
										<strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong><br>
										1. Analyze incident data over time to identify temporal patterns and seasonality in crime rates.<br>
										2. Examine changes in incident frequencies during specific time periods (e.g., weekends, holidays) to detect patterns.<br>
									  </p>
									  
									  <p>
										<strong>Social Network Analysis:</strong><br>
										1. Explore connections between incidents by analyzing incident descriptions to identify potential links between offenders or modus operandi.<br>
										2. Investigate any relationships between incidents occurring in the same neighborhood or police district.<br>
									  </p>
									  
									  <p>
										<strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong><br>
										1. Build predictive models using historical incident data to forecast future crime occurrences in specific locations or time periods.<br>
										2. Utilize features such as incident type, location, and time to predict the likelihood of incidents.<br>
									  </p>
									  
									  <p>
										<strong>Resource Allocation Optimization:</strong><br>
										1. Analyze incident severity and location data to optimize the allocation of police officers, emergency services, or other resources.<br>
										2. Identify high-demand areas where additional resources may be required based on incident frequencies or incident types.<br>
									  </p>
									  
									  <p>
										<strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong><br>
										1. Compare incident patterns across different police districts, neighborhoods, or time periods to identify disparities or trends.<br>
									  </p>
